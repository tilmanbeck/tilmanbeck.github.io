Hi there! Iam a doctoral candidate in the UKP Labl at Technische Universit√§t, Darmstadt. My research interests are deep learning applications in natural language processing. More precisely I work on argumentation mining where I investigate methods to aggregate the plethora of argumentative text in various text genres and domains. Most of my free time I spent with listening to and making music. Besides I work on hobby projects, some of which you can read about in the "Projects" section.
